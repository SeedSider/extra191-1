        <h3 id="whatisamemo">What is a 'memo'?</h3>
        <p>Memo is a weekly note handwritten on a piece of paper containing <strong>your</strong> knowledge of the course material for the corresponding week. It can be a summary, a word-for-word copy from the whole course material's slide (or books), a set of questions and the answers from the past exams, or it can just be blank. It is all <strong>yours*</strong>.</p>
        <p>Since it is going to be made weekly, there will be 11 memos (6 before mid-term, 5 before finals). In those exams you can bring your memos and use it as <em class = "text-secondary">cheat sheets</em>.   </p>
        <p><strong><em class = "text-secondary"></strong> *Your memo will be yours to use. Make it wholeheartedly, with love.</em>  </p>

                        <p>And the last but not least, never think that your memo is complete, because it will never be. It is better to think that your memo will always have something missed and not included in it. With that mindset not only you will try harder to make a better memo but you will also pour your desire and heart when making it, hence resulting a memo with higher chance to be 'useful' in the exam.</p>
