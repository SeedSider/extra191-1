# PREREQUISITES  

Preparing the necessary tool for the Operating System course.  

Throughout the course you will be using `Badak` a lot to accompany your learning. `Badak` (`badak.cs.ui.ac.id`) is a secured server that can only be accessed from internal of Universitas Indonesia. In order to use it, we will be using SSH (Secure Shell or Secure Socket Shell), a network protocol that permits a secure way to access a computer over an unsecured network.

### Windows
If you are using Windows 10 version 1809 or newer, Microsoft have implemented OpenSSH from the update on September 2018. You should find that SSH is already installed on your Windows 10 computer, thus you can proceed to use the built-in Windows Powershell or Command Prompt.  

And if you are using Windows with version older than the one mentioned above (Windows 7, 8, or 10 version older than 1809), do not worry because you still can use a third-party software, and in this case we will be using [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/).  

As stated in the website, PuTTY is an SSH  and telnet client with terminal emulation. It is typically used for remote access to server computers over a network using the SSH protocol.  

To download PuTTY, you can head to this link for the latest release: [https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html), and look at the 'Package files' part of the page as shown in the blue box in the image below.

Do not forget to download it correspondingly to your running Windows (32-bit or 64-bit).  

### Linux and MacOS
For those of you who have Linux or MacOS running as the operating system on your computer, both Linux and MacOS also have OpenSSH installed within the system. In this case, you can proceed to use the built-in Terminal, or use your preferred terminal emulator.
