# MEMO  

Everything you need to know about the '*talisman*' you will need for exams.

### What is a 'memo'?
Memo is a weekly note handwritten on a piece of paper containing **your** knowledge of the course material for the corresponding week. It can be a summary, a word-for-word copy from the whole course material's slide (or books), a set of questions and the answers from the past exams, or it can just be blank. It is all __yours*__.

Since it is going to be made weekly, there will be 11 memos (6 before mid-term, 5 before finals). In those exams you can bring your memos and use it as *cheat sheets*.   

__*__ *Your memo will be yours to use. Make it wholeheartedly, with love.*  

### Why 'memo'?
- Memo will prepare you with pre-knowledges you will need before going to the class, thus making you at least know what will be learned this week and if there is a pop-up question coming from the lecturer, you can answer it correctly and win some weekly scores to be added to your SIAK.
- Memo helps you to prepare for exams. It is designed to make the students learn gradually each week, therefore preventing the bad study habit of trying to cram for tests the night before. 
- Memo will be used as your cheat sheets. A good memo can bring you good fortune for the exam score, and *vice versa*.  

### Advices on making 'memo'
- Do not procrastinate to make the memo until the exam is approaching. It will defeats the purpose of the memo itself, and most probably will not produce the optimal memo you need for the exam either.
- Try adding in several sets of questions and answers from the past exams. The exams usually have a pattern and you can learn how to solve it and then put it in your memo, so if the same pattern of question appears in your exam, you already know how to produce the answer. 
- And the last but not least, never think that your memo is complete, because it will never be. It is better to think that your memo will always have something missed and not included in it. With that mindset not only you will try harder to make a better memo but you will also pour your desire and heart when making it, hence resulting a memo with higher chance to be 'useful' in the exam.
